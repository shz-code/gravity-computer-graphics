# Simple Gravity App with freeglut

This project provides a simple interactive visualization tool that allows users to explore and compare the effects of gravity on falling objects on different planets. It uses the freeglut library for rendering graphics.

# Features
- Visualization of gravity effects on falling objects(apple).
- Comparison of gravity strength on different planets.
- Interactive controls to change parameters such as planet selection.

# Prerequisites
- C/C++ compiler
- freeglut library. [Refer to this tutorial](https://youtu.be/7rLo69vCooU?si=d1iqBGpwfx4zGqFt)
